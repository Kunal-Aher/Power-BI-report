📊 Data-Driven Decisions Start with Smart Insights! 🚀
Over the past week, I had the opportunity to deep-dive into a multi-dimensional dataset comprising Sales, Customer Service, and Financial performance – and here's what I uncovered through an interactive dashboard! 🔍
💼 Key Insights from the Dashboard Analysis:
✅ Sales Trends:
Highest revenue was generated from online orders, particularly for products like Paneer Tikka Pizzabun and Large Crispy Chole Pizzabun.
South India led in sales contribution, with agents like Roch Cousineau and Adrien Martin driving consistent performance.
📍 Regional Performance:
The South and North regions topped the charts in revenue, highlighting targeted marketing and fulfillment efficiency.
West and East regions show potential for growth with focused promotions.
🤝 Customer Service Highlights:
Most common customer queries were related to order requests and follow-ups, with a noticeable number of complaints being handled efficiently.
Agent performance was a key factor in customer satisfaction, with average ratings hovering between 6 and 9.
📈 Financial Insights:
Region-wise revenue tracking revealed sales spikes aligned with marketing campaigns.
Discount impact analysis showed that smaller, strategic discounts contributed significantly to boosting overall revenue.
✨ What this project truly emphasized:
"Behind every number is a story—and dashboards help us narrate it with clarity."
🔧 Tools used: Excel (Power Pivot, Charts), data cleaning, and exploratory analysis techniques.
